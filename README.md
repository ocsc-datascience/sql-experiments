# sql-experiments
SQL Project as part of the USC Data Analytics Bootcamp Program

In this project, we explore advanced SQL functionality using the
"sakila" test database that's provided as part of MySQL. We employ
such functionality as <code>JOIN</code>, <code>GROUP BY</code>, and
subqueries, all involving two or multiple tables.
